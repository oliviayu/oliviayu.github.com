      <description>State-space models were originally developed by control engineers, particularly for applications requiring continuous updating of the current position. An example, from the field of navigation systems, is “controlling the position of a space rocket”. They have also found increasing use in many types of time-series problems, including parameter estimation, smoothing, and prediction. Structural time-series models are state-space models for time-series data. They are useful in practice because they are flexible (a very large class of models can be expressed in state space forms, including all ARIMA and VARMA models) and modular (the latent state as well as the model matrices can be assembled from a library of component sub-models to capture important features of the data).</description>
