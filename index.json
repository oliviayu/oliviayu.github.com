An example, from the field of navigation systems, is “controlling the position of a space rocket”. They have also found increasing use in many types of time-series problems, including parameter estimation, smoothing, and prediction. Structural time-series models are state-space models for time-series data. They are useful in practice because they are flexible (a very large class of models can be expressed in state space forms, including all ARIMA and VARMA models) and modular (the latent state as well as the model matrices can be assembled from a library of component sub-models to capture important features of the data). Several widely used state-component models are avaialble for capturing the trend, seasonality or effects of holidays.\nGeneral Form A general form of (univariate) structural time-series model, which underlies the Kalman filter, can be written as \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; y_t = Z_t^T \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t, \\qquad (observation\\; equation)\\\\ \u0026amp; \\alpha_{t+1} = T_t\\alpha_{t} + R_t\\eta_t, \\qquad (transition/state\\; equation),\\\\ \u0026amp; \\epsilon_t\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_t),\\quad \\eta_t \\sim N(0, Q_t) \\end{split}\\] where \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a \\(m\\)-dimensional state vector, \\(Z_t\\) is a \\(m\\)-dimensional output vector, \\(T_t\\) is a \\(m\\times m\\) transition matrix, \\(R_t\\) is a \\(m\\times q\\) control matrix, \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is a scalar observation error, and \\(\\eta_t\\) is a \\(q\\)-dimensional system error with a \\(q\\times q\\) state-diffusion matrix \\(Q_t\\) where \\(q\\leq d\\).\n The state vector \\(\\alpha_t\\) is of prime importance and is usually unobserved or partially known. Although it may not be directly observable, it is often reasonable to assume that we know how it changes over time, and we denote the updating equation by the transition/state equation above.\n The matrices \\(Z_t, T_t, R_t\\) typically contain a mix of known values (often 0 and 1) and unknown parameters.\n The observation equation links the observed data \\(y_t\\) with the unobserved latent state \\(\\alpha_t\\). The transition equation defines how the latent space evolves over time.\n The \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are generally assumed to be serially uncorrelated and also to be uncorrelated with each other at all time periods. In practice, we often assume \\(\\epsilon_t\\sim N(0,\\sigma_t^2)\\).\n The term \\(R_t\\eta_t\\) allows us to incorporate state components of less than full ranks: a model for seasonality will be the most important example.\n   State Components Independent state components can be combined by concatenating their observation vectors \\(Z_t\\), and arranging the other model matrices as elements in a block diagonal matrix.\nLocal linear trend The local linear trend is a porpular choice for modelling trends because it quickly adapts to local variation, which is desirable when making short-term predictions. However, this degree of flexibility may not be desired when making long-term predicitons, as such predictions often come with implausibly wide uncertainty intervals.\nA local linear trend allows both level and slope to be stochastic. The level and the slope are estimated by giving more weight on the most recent observations. The local linear trend model for \\(y_t\\) can be written as, \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; y_t = \\mu_t +\\epsilon_t, \\\\ \u0026amp; \\mu_{t+1} = \\mu_{t} + \\delta_t + \\eta_{\\mu,t}, \\qquad \\text{(stochastic level component)}\\\\ \u0026amp; \\delta_{t+1} = \\delta_t + \\eta_{\\delta,t}, \\qquad \\text{(stochastic slope component)}\\\\ \\end{split}\\] where \\(\\mu_t\\) is the value of the trend at time \\(t\\), \\(\\delta_t\\) is the expected increase in \\(\\mu\\) between time \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\) so it can be thought of as the slope at time \\(t\\).\nThe model can be rewritten as \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; y_t = [1\\quad 0]\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\mu_t\\\\\\delta_t\\end{matrix}\\right] +\\epsilon_t, \\\\ \u0026amp; \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\mu_{t+1}\\\\\\delta_{t+1}\\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\mu_t\\\\\\delta_t\\end{matrix}\\right] + \\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\eta_{\\mu, t}\\\\\\eta_{\\delta, t}\\end{matrix}\\right] \\end{split}\\] where \\(Z_t = (1,0)^T\\), \\(\\alpha_t = (\\mu_t, \\delta_t)^T\\), \\(T_t = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\), \\(R_t=\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\), and \\(\\eta_t = (\\eta_{\\mu,t}, \\eta_{\\delta, t})^T\\).\n Seasonality There are several commonly used state-component models to capture seasonality. The most frequently used model in the time domain is \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; y_t = \\gamma_t +\\epsilon_t, \\\\ \u0026amp; \\gamma_{t+1} = - \\sum_{i=0}^{s-2}\\gamma_{t-i} + \\eta_{\\gamma, t}, \\end{split}\\] where \\(s\\) is the number of seasons (or seasonal duration) and \\(\\gamma_t\\) denotes their joint contribution to the observed response \\(y_t\\). The mean of \\(\\gamma_{t+1}\\) is such that the total seasonal effect is zero when summed over \\(s\\) seasons. The model can be rewritten as \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; y_t = [1\\quad 0 \\quad \\cdots\\quad 0]\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\gamma_{t+1}\\\\\\gamma_t\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\gamma_{t-s+3}\\end{matrix}\\right] +\\epsilon_t, \\\\ \u0026amp; \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\gamma_{t+1}\\\\\\gamma_t\\\\\\gamma_{t-1}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\gamma_{t-s+4}\\\\ \\gamma_{t-s+3}\\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} -1 \u0026amp; - 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; -1 \u0026amp; -1 \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp;0\u0026amp; 0\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp;\\vdots \u0026amp;\\vdots \u0026amp;\\vdots \u0026amp;\\vdots \u0026amp;\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\gamma_{t}\\\\\\gamma_{t-1}\\\\\\gamma_{t-2}\\\\\\vdots \\\\ \\gamma_{t-s+3}\\\\ \\gamma_{t-s+2}\\end{matrix}\\right] + \\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\eta_{\\gamma, t} \\end{split}\\]\nThe seasonal model can be generalized to allow for multiple seasonal components with differen periods.\n Linear regression The covariates in structual time series models are assumed to be contemporaneous. The coefficients of the contemporaneous covariates \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) can be static or time-varying. A static regression can be written in state-space form by setting \\[Z_t = \\beta^T \\mathbf{x}_t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_t =1.\\] A dynamic regression component can be written as \\[\\begin{split} \u0026amp; \\mathbf{x}_t^T\\beta_t = \\sum_{j=1}^J x_{j,t} \\beta_{j,t}\\\\ \u0026amp; \\beta_{j, t+1} = \\beta_{j,t} + \\eta_{\\beta,j,t}, \\end{split}\\] where \\(\\beta_{j,t}\\) is the cofficient for the \\(j\\)-th covariate \\(x_{j,t}\\). The state-space form is given as \\[Z_t = \\mathbf{x}_t,\\quad \\alpha_t =\\beta_t,\\quad T_t = R_t = I_{J\\times J}.\\]\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5a43568427900f38d6e1a6d76c89c1f3","permalink":"/post/2019-03-21-bsts/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-03-21-bsts/","section":"post","summary":"State-space models were originally developed by control engineers, particularly for applications requiring continuous updating of the current position.
